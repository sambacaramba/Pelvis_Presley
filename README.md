# Pelvis_Presley
## Function used for choosing multiple folders: [(Douglas Schwarz (2024). uipickfiles: uigetfile on steroids](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10867-uipickfiles-uigetfile-on-steroids), MATLAB Central File Exchange. Retrieved December 2, 2024.

### Measure distances between anatomical landmarks from ÂµCT data.

### File order is randomized and filenames are hidden from user during measurements to prevent bias.

### Run script and choose folders with pelvic area cropped. Automatic thresholding using multithresh in matlab. Data should have different gray values for air, soft tissue and bone. Highest threshold (Bone) is extraced as isosurface for marking landmarks. Isosurface is presented to the user with 3D rotation always activated. Rotate to desired view and press button to mark corresponding landmark. If errors are made, just mark the point again by pressing the mark button. (old point will remain visible but only the last marked point is used). Finish with exit and save and wait for ext sample to start. 

### Result are saved as excel file to the parent folder of the chosen data.
